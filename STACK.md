# Kreatekno Website: Tech Stack

_Last updated: 2026-10-14. Versions are the latest on npm as of that date; pin whatever `create-next-app` installs for React and TypeScript._

What the site says and how it behaves: `SITE-BRIEF.md`. All copy: `COPY.md`. Milestones: `PLAN.md`. Behaviour reference: the home prototype in `prototype/`.

---

## 1. Libraries

| Layer | Choice | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Framework | **Next.js** (App Router), static generation | 16.4.x | Every page ships as static HTML: fast first paint, fully crawlable |
| UI | React | 19.x | Comes with Next.js |
| Language | TypeScript, `strict` | as installed by Next.js | |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS v4** (CSS-first `@theme` tokens) | 4.3.x | Tokens copied from the prototype's `:root` block |
| Fonts | `next/font/google`: Bricolage Grotesque (headings), Plus Jakarta Sans (body) | built in | Self-hosted, no layout shift |
| Motion | **GSAP + ScrollTrigger**, `@gsap/react` (`useGSAP`) | 3.15.x | Pinned story stage, scrubbed timelines, `matchMedia` per breakpoint |
| Smooth scroll | Lenis | 1.3.x | Synced to ScrollTrigger |
| i18n | **next-intl** | 4.14.x | ID default without prefix, EN under `/en`, translated slugs |
| Long-form content | MDX (`@next/mdx`) + frontmatter validated with **zod** | 16.4.x / 4.x | Articles and portfolio entries as files in the repo, no CMS |
| Icons | `@phosphor-icons/react` (SSR import) | 2.1.x | Same icon set as the prototype |
| Workflow diagrams | **elkjs** for layout + hand-rendered SVG | 0.12.x | Auto layout left→right on desktop, top→bottom on phones |
| Analytics | `@vercel/analytics`; GA4 optional | 2.0.x | WhatsApp clicks tracked per section |
| Testing | Playwright + `@axe-core/playwright` | 1.64.x | Story beats at 375 / 768 / 1440px, accessibility checks |

## 2. Folder structure

The Next.js app lives in **`site/`** so it stays separate from the docs, the prototype and the brand files.

```

## 3. Content model

- **UI copy** (nav, story beats, cards, capabilities, FAQ, CTAs, footer, WhatsApp messages, SEO metadata) lives in `messages/id.json` and `messages/en.json`. `COPY.md` stays the human-editable source; a script turns its tables into the two JSON files so they never drift.
- **Industry examples** (chat, admin, calendar, knowledge Q&A per industry) are part of the messages, keyed by industry.
- **Articles** (MDX), frontmatter: `title`, `summary`, `category` (otomasi / whatsapp / ai), `date`, `cover?`, `translationOf?`.
- **Portfolio entries** (MDX), frontmatter: `title`, `client`, `clientLogo?`, `industry`, `solutions[]`, `summary`, `result`, `workflow?` (name of a sanitized workflow file), `quote?`, `date`.
- All frontmatter is validated with zod at build time; a bad entry fails the build.

## 4. Routing and i18n

- next-intl with `defaultLocale: 'id'`, `localePrefix: 'as-needed'` (Indonesian at `/`, English at `/en`).
- Translated pathnames: `/portofolio` ↔ `/en/portfolio`, `/artikel` ↔ `/en/articles`, `/tentang` ↔ `/en/about`, `/kebijakan-privasi` ↔ `/en/privacy-policy`.
- `generateStaticParams` for both locales and every slug, so the whole site is static.
- The language switch keeps the visitor on the same page in the other language.
- Every page sets `alternates.languages` (hreflang) and a canonical URL.

## 5. Home page implementation notes

**Story stage** (`components/story/StoryStage.tsx`, client component)
- One section with a tall wrapper (~720vh desktop, ~640vh phones) and a `position: sticky` stage inside it. GSAP drives one timeline from the wrapper's scroll progress (no `pin`, so sticky and ScrollTrigger never fight).
- `beats.ts` holds the beat list: time markers, which buttons show, and the layout class for desktop and phone. Positions per beat follow `SITE-BRIEF.md` 5.1.
- `gsap.matchMedia()` builds separate timelines for desktop (≥768px) and phones, and cleans them up on resize.
- Problem cards: two faces (problem / ✓), flipped with `rotationY`. On phones they become a chip row placed under the headline (measured after fonts load and on every `ScrollTrigger` refresh).
- Process steps (beat 5) light up one by one inside the same timeline.
- The containers of all beats overlap, so containers get `pointer-events: none` and the visible beat gets `pointer-events: auto`.
- `prefers-reduced-motion`: no sticky stage, all beats rendered as normal sections in order, cards in their ✓ state.
- **Zones overlay**: the prototype's "Area video" tool, shown only when the URL has `?zones=1` (for the team, never linked publicly).
- **MediaSlot**: the full-bleed background layer of the stage. For now a colour fill that shifts from cool to warm. It takes a source later (format and assets are decided by the Kreatekno team); whatever goes in must be scaled to cover the stage, load progressively, and pause when off screen.

**Other sections**
- Capabilities: industry switcher as an accessible tab list (arrow keys), examples swapped with a short fade.
- Logo marquee: CSS animation, paused on hover, static under reduced motion.
- FAQ: native `<details>` plus `FAQPage` JSON-LD from the same data.
- Mobile WhatsApp bar: appears after the story stage, hides at the final CTA.
- Scroll reveals use IntersectionObserver, never a scroll listener.

## 6. WhatsApp and analytics

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WA_NUMBER` (international format, digits only) feeds every link: `https://wa.me/<number>?text=<prefilled message in the current locale>`.
- Each button carries a section name (`hero`, `story-end`, `faq`, `final`, `nav`, `mobile-bar`, `footer`…). A click sends `whatsapp_click { section, locale }`.
- Vercel Analytics needs no cookie banner. If GA4 is added, add a consent banner (decline non-essential by default).

## 7. SEO (technical)

- `generateMetadata` per page from the SEO table in `COPY.md`.
- `app/sitemap.ts` lists both locales with alternates; `app/robots.ts`.
- Open Graph images generated with `next/og` (logo + headline, brand colours).
- JSON-LD: `Organization` and `ProfessionalService` (Pekanbaru address, phone, opening hours) on every page; `FAQPage` on Home; `Article` on articles; `BreadcrumbList` on detail pages.
- One H1 per page. Home's H1 = keyword line + problem headline (see `SITE-BRIEF.md` 9).

## 8. Workflow diagrams (portfolio)

- `scripts/sanitize-workflow.ts` reads an exported n8n workflow from `Assets/workflows/` and keeps only node types, names and connections. Credentials, IDs, URLs, webhook paths and parameters are dropped. **Raw exports are never published.**
- A hand-edited story layer groups nodes into 4–7 plain-language steps (ID + EN) and folds helper nodes (Set, IF, Merge, Code) into their step.
- `WorkflowDiagram` lays the steps out with elkjs and renders SVG; node types map to app icons, with a distinct AI node style. Steps light up in order when scrolled into view; static under reduced motion.

## 9. Performance and accessibility budget

- Lighthouse mobile ≥ 85; LCP < 2.5s on 4G mid-range Android; CLS < 0.1.
- No layout-affecting animation: only `transform` and `opacity`.
- Blur effects only on small, fixed or sticky elements (nav, story cards).
- Tap targets ≥ 44px; visible focus states; WCAG AA contrast for all text, including text on the semi-transparent story cards.
- JavaScript for the story stage and GSAP loads only on the Home page.

## 10. Quality and deploy

- ESLint (Next.js config) + Prettier; TypeScript strict; `next build` must pass with zod-validated content.
- Playwright: screenshots of each story beat at 375, 768 and 1440px; navigation and language-switch tests; axe accessibility scan per page.
- **Vercel**: project root `site/`, preview deploy per branch, production on `main`. Domain `kreatekno.com` pointed at Vercel when ready.
- Environment variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WA_NUMBER`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` (optional).
- Design and QA skills installed in `.claude/skills/` (Taste, Emil, Impeccable) are used for the visual pass, the motion review and the final audit.
